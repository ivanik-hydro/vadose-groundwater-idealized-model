# Project Plan: Idealized Recharge Pulse Modeling

## Research question
How do episodic storms in arid/semi-arid climates translate into recharge, and what controls the lag/attenuation through the vadose zone?

## Model
Geometry: (1D column / 2D cross-section)
Vadose: (HYDRUS / UZF)
Groundwater: (MODFLOW)

## Experiments
1) Storm intensity experiment (same annual P, different storminess)
2) Soil texture sensitivity
3) ET sensitivity (seasonality or constant)

## Outputs
- Time series: infiltration, percolation, recharge, head response
- Summary metrics: recharge efficiency, lag time, damping ratio
