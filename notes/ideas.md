# Project idea (working notes)

Goal: Build an idealized vadose–groundwater model to understand recharge pulses in arid/semi-arid settings.

Initial questions:
- What storm intensity/duration is needed for percolation past the root zone?
- How long does it take a recharge pulse to reach the water table?
- How does changing soil texture or ET change recharge efficiency?

First model choice:
- Option A: HYDRUS–MODFLOW coupling
- Option B: MODFLOW 6 + UZF package
