# Vadose–Groundwater Idealized Modeling Project

This repository contains small, idealized hydrologic modeling experiments exploring
how episodic recharge propagates through the vadose zone and affects groundwater systems
in arid and semi-arid environments.

## Goals
- Learn vadose zone processes and recharge mechanisms
- Practice coupled modeling (HYDRUS–MODFLOW)
- Build intuition for climate variability and recharge timing

## Status
Early exploratory phase.
